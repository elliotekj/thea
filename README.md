# Thea ([Documentation](https://elliotekj.com/docs/thea))

Thea is a from-memory website generator and server designed to get the requested resource from server to client as quickly as possible, with as little setup as possible. Much like a static site generator, Thea takes HTML / Markdown / etc files and renders pages from them via liquid-based templates. Where a static site generator would write those pages to HTML files, Thea keeps them in, and serves them from, memory.

Design goals (in order):

1. Outstanding server to client performance.
2. Frustration-free setup and configuration.
3. Powerful, versatile templating.
